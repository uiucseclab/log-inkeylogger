# log-inKeylogger

## ECE 419 - Final Project

### Introduction

The idea behind our project was to make a keylogger that went beyond the usual 'capture keys and send to a server' keyloggers on the market. The idea was to have a keylogger that would capture the keys everytime the user hits the ENTER or TAB keys, clicks their mouse or every 10 seconds (with a resetting timer.) These choices were made on the fact that ENTER and TAB are the buttons usually pressed to submit information or to navigate to a new field on a website. While the keys were captured and sent during the 4 actions above, we also take a screenshot of the victim's screen. This would help when a victim happened to go to a website through auto-fill or their favorites. We would have their website on hand while also having any information they typed.
